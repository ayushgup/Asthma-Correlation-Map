# Asthma-Correlation-Map
Grand Finalist project for Hack This Help Kids Hackathon at Carnegie Mellon University 10/6/18

Project hosted on the Google Cloud Platform using Google Maps API. Data is contunuously mined from Data.gov and the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center. This visualization helps show the geographical correlation between known asthma hospitalizations in pediatric patients admitted into the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh over the past two years and environmental hazards such as Air Quality Index reading from sensors, buildings with a Clean Indoor Act Exceptions(Bars and Restaurants with heavy smoking) and reported illegal toxic dump sites from public and industrial sources. This overlay map helps to visualize information from all these disparate sources in one easy context. The idea is to create an open source community resource that allows individuals concerned about the asthma conditions in their neighborhood to easily access this information.
